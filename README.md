# Form

Basic front-end form for grabbing user input.

The purpose of this coding project is to reinforce the lessons I learned in the Odin Project Intermediate HTML and CSS course. Such lessons include forms, advanced CSS selectors, custom CSS properties, positioning, etc. Visually appealing design is not the objective. My focus is understanding CSS and HTML fundamentals.
